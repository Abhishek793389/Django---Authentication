  <h1>About User Authentication System</h1>

  <p class="pi">
    The <strong>User Authentication System</strong> in a web application is essential for ensuring that only authorized
    users can access certain features or pages. It involves verifying a user's identity using credentials such as a
    <strong>username and password</strong>. Below is an overview of how our authentication and session management system
    works.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Features of the Authentication System</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Registration:</strong> Users can sign up by providing their personal details like username, password,
      and email.</li>
    <li><strong>Login:</strong> Registered users log in by entering their valid credentials.</li>
    <li><strong>Session Management:</strong> A session is created after a successful login, allowing users to stay
      authenticated across multiple pages.</li>
    <li><strong>Dashboard Access:</strong> After logging in, users are redirected to their personal dashboard where they
      can manage their activities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Session Management and User Activities</h2>
  <p class="pi">
    Our system uses Djangoâ€™s built-in session management to keep track of logged-in users. Once authenticated, the user
    can perform the following activities:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Add Blog:</strong> Users can create new blog posts with a title and content.</li>
    <li><strong>View Blog:</strong> Users can view their own blogs and those created by others.</li>
    <li><strong>Update Blog:</strong> Users can edit the content of their existing blogs.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete Blog:</strong> Users can remove their blogs from the platform.</li>
    <li><strong>Change Password:</strong> Users can update their password from the dashboard for better security.</li>
    <li><strong>Logout:</strong> When users log out, the session ends, and they must log in again to access their
      dashboard.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete User Account:</strong> Users can delete their accounts, which removes all associated data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Password Hashing:</strong> User passwords are securely stored using hashing algorithms.</li>
    <li><strong>Session Expiration:</strong> Sessions expire after a period of inactivity to prevent unauthorized
      access.</li>
    <li><strong>CSRF Protection:</strong> Cross-Site Request Forgery protection is enabled for secure form submissions.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Django Framework:</strong> Used for building the backend authentication system.</li>
    <li><strong>HTML & CSS:</strong> For the frontend interface and styling.</li>
    <li><strong>MySQL Database:</strong> For storing user data and blog information.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;" class="pi">
    This user authentication system ensures that users can securely manage their data and perform actions such as
    adding, updating, and deleting blogs, while keeping their personal information safe.
